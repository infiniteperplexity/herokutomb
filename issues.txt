- zombies too similar in color to background?  I've never had a problem though...
What have the pain points been so far?
-	Elevation
-	People going off wandering and picking stuff up.
-	Not understanding delayed effects of actions.
-	Not using the mouse.
- Not trying enough different tasks.
- I don't think anyone has even remotely attempted to use navigation mode.
