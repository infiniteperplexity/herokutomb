-- smaller, newer issues
- hovering while assigning tasks should tell what the task will do on that square
- lighting doesn't update properly after digging, until you place a light
- squares with the player or friendly monsters should always appear "lit"
- list requirements for making crafts
- call "craft" something other than "craft"

-- big issues
- consider better keyboard shortcuts
- try to put more stuff on menu instead of overlay

--ideas
- add ravens, which are diurnal and feed on your zombies
- make bats nocturnal...where do they go during the day?
- add caves
